      <p className="article-content">
        The Giant of the Orient is an extraordinary blue sapphire originally found near Adams Peak in Sri Lanka in 1902. Initially weighing over 600 carats, the rough stone was cut and polished down to 466 carats, making it one of the largest faceted blue sapphires of its kind at the time. Known for its intense medium blue color and a unique orange-red fluorescence under ultraviolet light, the stone was sold in 1907 to an anonymous American collector. It resurfaced briefly at a Christie's auction in 2004 but failed to sell. The Giant of the Orient remains one of the rarest and most mysterious sapphires in the world.
